# How to Activate Windows XP with KMS Activator 55
 
Windows XP is an old but still popular operating system that requires activation to use all its features. However, if you have lost your product key or you don't want to pay for a new one, you can use a tool called KMS Activator 55 to activate Windows XP for free.
 
KMS Activator 55 is a software that can generate and apply a valid activation code for Windows XP using the Key Management Service (KMS) protocol. KMS is a technology that allows organizations to activate multiple computers with a single key. KMS Activator 55 mimics the KMS server and tricks Windows XP into thinking that it is activated by a legitimate source.
