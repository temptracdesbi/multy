## What is Sonic Scenarist BD 513?
 
Sonic Scenarist BD 513 is a collection of tools that are designed for professional Blu-ray Disc authoring. It is based on the same advanced technology that has made Sonic BD production systems the choice of more authoring facilities than all other BD production platforms combined[^4^]. Sonic Scenarist BD 513 includes the following components:
 
- **Scenarist BD**: This is the industry-standard Blu-ray Disc and BD3D authoring system that features both HDMV (High Definition Movie Mode) and BD-J (Blu-ray Java) programming modes for Blu-ray Disc and Blu-ray 3D titles[^4^]. It allows you to have specification-level control over all aspects of the Blu-ray Disc specification, including advanced interactivity, graphics, audio, subtitles, playlists, navigation commands, and more[^6^].
- **Scenarist Designer**: This is a menu design plug-in for Adobe Photoshop that lets you quickly export menus and buttons (in all states) for easy import into Scenarist BD[^4^]. It works with Photoshop to output menu backgrounds, button states, and color palettes. It saves you hundreds of hours of effort per title by automatically slicing all button graphics[^4^].
- **Scenarist QC Studio**: This is a professional-grade BD emulation tool that lets you preview and test your BD projects before burning or replication[^2^]. It supports both HDMV and BD-J modes, as well as 3D playback. It also allows you to perform quality assurance checks on your discs, such as verifying AACS compliance, checking region codes, testing seamless branching, and more[^2^].
