To get started, you need to download and install Devcomponents DotNetBar V90 from [here](https://www.devcomponents.com/downloads.aspx).

The RibbonControl component consists of several parts: a ribbon strip, a quick access toolbar, a system caption item and a ribbon tab item panel. You can customize each part by using the properties window or the smart tag menu. For example, you can change the text, image and color of the system caption item by using the CaptionText, CaptionImage and CaptionBackColor properties.
 
To add some ribbon tabs and groups to the ribbon strip, you can use the RibbonTabItem and RibbonBar components. Drag a RibbonTabItem component from the toolbox to the ribbon strip and change its Text property to "Home". Then, drag a RibbonBar component from the toolbox to the ribbon tab item panel and change its Text property to "Countries". You can also change its LayoutType property to "FlowLayout" to make it automatically adjust its size and position according to its content.
 
To add some buttons and other controls to the ribbon bar, you can use the ButtonItem, ComboBoxItem, LabelItem and other components. Drag a ButtonItem component from the toolbox to the ribbon bar and change its Text property to "Load Data". You can also change its Image property to an image of your choice. Repeat this process to add another ButtonItem with the text "Save Data" and an image of your choice. Then, drag a ComboBoxItem component from the toolbox to the ribbon bar and change its Text property to "Select Country". You can also change its Width property to 150 and add some items to its Items collection using the collection editor. Finally, drag a LabelItem component from the toolbox to the ribbon bar and change its Text property to "Country Info". You should see something like this:
