One of the features of Unto The End is the use of passwords. Passwords are special items that can be found or traded in the game world. They can be used to access hidden areas, unlock doors or chests, or communicate with certain characters. Passwords are usually represented by symbols or drawings that you need to memorize or write down.
 
Here are some tips on how to find and use passwords in Unto The End:
 
- Explore every corner of the environment. Sometimes passwords are hidden in plain sight, such as on walls, signs or statues. Other times they are tucked away in secret passages or behind breakable objects. Be curious and look for clues.
- Interact with friendly characters. Some characters will offer you passwords in exchange for items or favors. For example, in the first cave, you can trade a bone for a password that opens a door to a shortcut. Other characters will give you passwords as a reward for helping them or sparing their lives.
- Pay attention to the context. Passwords are not random; they usually have a meaning or a connection to the place or situation where they are used. For example, in the second cave, you can find a password that resembles a snake on a wall near a pit of snakes. This password can be used to open a door that leads to a snake-themed area.
- Use passwords wisely. Passwords are consumable; once you use them, they are gone from your inventory. Therefore, you should only use them when you are sure they will benefit you or when you have no other choice. Sometimes it is better to save a password for later or try a different approach.

Passwords are an important part of Unto The End's gameplay and lore. They add an element of exploration, puzzle-solving and choice to the game. They also reveal more about the world and its inhabitants. By finding and using passwords, you can discover new secrets, challenges and rewards in your journey home.
  
Unto The End is not a game that holds your hand or guides you with markers or hints. You have to rely on your own skills and intuition to survive and progress. This can make the game challenging and frustrating at times, but also rewarding and satisfying when you overcome a difficult obstacle or enemy.
 
The game's combat system is one of its main features and attractions. It is based on realistic physics and animations, and requires precise timing, positioning and reaction. You can use various moves and tactics, such as blocking, dodging, countering, faking, barging and rolling. You can also use ranged weapons, such as knives or spears, to deal damage from a distance or distract your foes.
 
However, combat is not always the best or only option. Sometimes you can avoid fighting altogether by sneaking past enemies, using the environment to your advantage, or finding alternative routes. Sometimes you can also negotiate with enemies or show mercy to them. These choices can have consequences and affect the outcome of your adventure.
