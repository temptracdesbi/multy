Horary Numerology Of The Turf is a book by Rasajo, a renowned numerologist and astrologer who claims to have discovered the secrets of predicting the outcomes of games of chance and skill. The book was published in 1975 and covers topics such as dog racing, horse racing, roulette, lotteries, and stock markets. Rasajo explains how to use the principles of horary astrology, which is based on the position of the planets at the moment of a question or event, to calculate the lucky numbers and times for betting and playing.
 
The book has received mixed reviews from readers and critics. Some have praised it as a valuable and practical guide to numerology and gambling, while others have criticized it as a pseudoscientific and outdated work that relies on superstition and coincidence. One reviewer on Amazon.com wrote: "I have this book. This, is almost the penultimate guide to any game that deals with numbers. It is easy to hit 3 to 3+1 numbers on Super ball and similar lotteries around the world, and it is uncanny in roulette and racing."[^2^] Another reviewer on Goodreads.com wrote: "This book is rubbish. It is full of errors and contradictions. The author does not know anything about astrology or numerology. He just makes up his own rules and formulas. Do not waste your money or time on this book."

Horary Numerology Of The Turf is a book that may appeal to those who are interested in numerology, astrology, or gambling, but it should be taken with a grain of salt. The book does not provide any scientific evidence or logical explanation for its claims, and it may not work for everyone. As Rasajo himself admits in the introduction: "The methods given in this book are not infallible. They are only guides. The final decision rests with you."[^1^]
  
If you want to try the methods of horary numerology of the turf, you will need a few tools and some basic knowledge of astrology and numerology. You will need a horary chart, which is a diagram that shows the position of the planets at a given time and place. You can use an online horary chart generator or a software program to create one. You will also need a table of planetary hours, which is a system that divides each day into 24 periods of varying lengths according to the sunrise and sunset. You can find online calculators or apps that can help you with this.
 
Once you have these tools, you can follow the steps outlined by Rasajo in his book. First, you need to formulate a clear and specific question about the game or event you want to bet on. For example, "Who will win the next horse race at Belmont Park?" or "What numbers should I play in the Powerball lottery?" Then, you need to cast a horary chart for the moment and place of your question. This will show you the planetary influences that affect your question. Next, you need to interpret the chart according to the rules and guidelines given by Rasajo. He explains how to identify the significators, which are the planets that represent you and your question, and how to analyze their aspects, which are the angles they form with each other. He also gives specific formulas and tables for calculating the lucky numbers and times for different games and events.
