Masaan 2015 is a film that showcases the talent and vision of its director, Neeraj Ghaywan, who made his feature debut with this film. Ghaywan was an assistant director to Anurag Kashyap, one of the most influential filmmakers in Indian cinema, and he has learned well from his mentor. Masaan 2015 has a similar style and sensibility to Kashyap's films, such as Gangs of Wasseypur and Ugly, but it also has its own voice and identity.
 
The film is set in Varanasi, one of the oldest and most sacred cities in India, where life and death coexist in a paradoxical harmony. The film explores the contrast between tradition and modernity, between spirituality and materialism, between hope and despair. The film does not shy away from depicting the harsh realities of Indian society, such as corruption, poverty, violence and discrimination, but it also shows the resilience and dignity of its characters, who struggle to find their place and happiness in a changing world.
