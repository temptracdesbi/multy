However, to keep your Autoboss V30 up-to-date, you need to renew your software subscription every year with an update card. An update card is a security card that contains a card number and a security code that you need to enter in the update client software. The update card can extend your software subscription for one year and allow you to download the latest diagnostic software versions.
 
If you have purchased an update card and want to renew your Autoboss V30 software subscription, here are the steps you need to follow:
 
1. Log in to the Autoboss official website [http://www.autoboss.net/en/V30Update.asp](http://www.autoboss.net/en/V30Update.asp) [^1^]
2. Open the update client software from the desktop shortcut and enter your serial number and password. You can find these information on your Autoboss V30 device by clicking "Activate" [^3^]
3. After clicking "OK", the update client software will appear. If your account is valid, you will be taken to the download screen. If your account is about to expire or has expired, you will see a message reminding you to contact your local distributor to renew [^1^]
4. Press the "Renewal Settings" button on the right. Scratch the panel on your update card to get the security code. Input your product serial number, card number, and security code. Click "OK" to proceed [^2^]
5. Follow the system prompt until the renewal procedure is done. The expiration date will be automatically extended according to the subscription length on the card [^2^]
