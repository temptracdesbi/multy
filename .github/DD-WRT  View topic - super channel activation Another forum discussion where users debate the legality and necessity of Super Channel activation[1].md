DD-WRT is a popular open source firmware that can enhance the performance and functionality of many wireless devices. One of the features that DD-WRT offers is Super Channel, which allows you to use special frequencies that are normally restricted by regulatory domains. Super Channel can be useful for avoiding interference, increasing range, or accessing hidden networks.
