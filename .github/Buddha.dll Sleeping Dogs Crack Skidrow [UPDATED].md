# How to Fix Buddha.dll Missing Error in Sleeping Dogs
 
Sleeping Dogs is a popular action-adventure game that was released in 2012 by Square Enix. The game is set in Hong Kong and follows the story of Wei Shen, an undercover cop who infiltrates the Triads. Sleeping Dogs received critical acclaim for its gameplay, story, and graphics, but some players encountered a common problem: the buddha.dll missing error.
 
The buddha.dll missing error is a message that pops up when you try to launch the game and says something like "The program can't start because buddha.dll is missing from your computer. Try reinstalling the program to fix this problem." This error prevents you from playing the game and can be very frustrating.

Fortunately, there are some possible solutions to fix the buddha.dll missing error in Sleeping Dogs. Here are some of them:
 
- Reinstall the game. This is the simplest and most obvious solution. Sometimes, the game files may get corrupted or deleted during installation or update. Reinstalling the game may restore the missing buddha.dll file and fix the error.
- Download the buddha.dll file from a trusted source. If reinstalling the game does not work, you can try to download the buddha.dll file from a reliable website and place it in the game folder. However, be careful when downloading files from unknown sources, as they may contain viruses or malware that can harm your computer.
- Use a crack. A crack is a modified version of the game executable that bypasses the copy protection and allows you to play the game without a CD or DVD. Some cracks may also fix the buddha.dll missing error by replacing or adding the file to the game folder. However, using a crack may violate the terms of service of the game and may cause other issues such as bugs or crashes.

One of the most popular cracks for Sleeping Dogs is the Skidrow crack. Skidrow is a group of hackers who release cracks for various games. The Skidrow crack for Sleeping Dogs can be downloaded from various websites, but again, be careful of viruses and malware. To use the Skidrow crack, you need to follow these steps:

1. Download the Skidrow crack from a trusted source and extract it using WinRAR or 7-Zip.
2. Copy the contents of the extracted folder and paste them into your Sleeping Dogs game folder, replacing any existing files.
3. Launch the game using the SleepingDogs.exe file in the game folder.

The Skidrow crack should fix the buddha.dll missing error and allow you to play Sleeping Dogs without any problems. However, if you encounter any other issues or errors, you may need to look for other solutions or contact the game support.
