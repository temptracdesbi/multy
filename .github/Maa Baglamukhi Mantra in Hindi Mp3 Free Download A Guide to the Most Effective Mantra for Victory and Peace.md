One of the most popular ways to worship Maa Baglamukhi is by chanting her mantra. The mantra is a sacred sound that invokes the energy and blessings of the goddess. There are different versions of the mantra, but one of the most common ones is:

> Om Hleem Baglamukhi Sarvadushtaanaam Vaacham Mukham Padam Stambhaya Jihvaam Keelaya Buddhim Vinaashaaya Hleem Om Swaha

This mantra means: "O Goddess Baglamukhi, paralyze the speech, mouth, feet, tongue and intellect of all evil people. Destroy their mind and intellect. O Goddess Baglamukhi, I bow to you."
 
The mantra can be chanted for various purposes, such as:
 
- To overcome enemies, rivals and competitors
- To win legal cases and court matters
- To cure diseases and ailments
- To attain wealth and prosperity
- To enhance intelligence and wisdom
- To achieve success in career and education
- To protect oneself from accidents and dangers
- To attract love and happiness

The mantra can be chanted in any language, but many devotees prefer to chant it in Hindi, as it is believed to be more effective and powerful. However, chanting the mantra requires some rules and guidelines, such as:

- The mantra should be chanted with a pure mind and heart, without any selfish or negative motives.
- The mantra should be chanted with full concentration and devotion, without any distractions or interruptions.
- The mantra should be chanted at least 108 times daily, preferably in the morning or evening.
- The mantra should be chanted while facing east or north, sitting on a yellow cloth or mat.
- The mantra should be chanted while wearing yellow clothes and using a yellow rosary or mala.
- The mantra should be chanted while offering yellow flowers, turmeric, honey, ghee and sweets to the goddess.

Chanting the mantra regularly can bring miraculous results in one's life. However, some people may not have the time or resources to chant the mantra daily.
