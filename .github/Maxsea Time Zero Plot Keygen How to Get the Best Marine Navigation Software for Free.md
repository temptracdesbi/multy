First, you need to install the software on your computer. You can download it from the official website or use a keygen to generate a serial number. The keygen is a program that creates a unique code that can activate the software. However, using a keygen may be illegal or unsafe, so we recommend that you purchase the software from a trusted source.

To import charts, go to File > Import Charts and select the folder where your charts are stored. To download charts, go to File > Download Charts and choose the area and type of charts that you want. You can also use the Mapkey Chart feature to access a large database of charts online.
 
After loading the charts, you can start plotting your route. To do this, go to Tools > Route Editor and click on the map where you want to add waypoints. You can also right-click on the map and select Add Waypoint. You can edit the waypoints by dragging them or using the properties panel on the right. You can also add notes, photos, or videos to each waypoint.
 
When you have finished plotting your route, you can save it by going to File > Save Route or by clicking on the Save icon on the toolbar. You can also export your route to other formats, such as GPX, KML, or CSV, by going to File > Export Route and choosing the format that you want.
