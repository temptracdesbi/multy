Resident Evil 7 Biohazard 7 Teaser: Beginning Hour is a demo version of the survival horror game Resident Evil 7 Biohazard, which was released in 2017. The demo lets you explore a creepy house and uncover its secrets, while avoiding the deadly threats that lurk in the shadows. The demo is available for free on PlayStation Network, Steam, and Xbox Live.
 
If you want to make the demo easier or more fun, you can download and use a trainer, which is a program that modifies the game's memory and allows you to activate various cheats, such as infinite health, ammo, items, speed, and more. There are several trainers available online for the demo, but one of the most popular ones is the FLiNG Trainer, which has 14 options and works with different versions of the game.

To download and use the FLiNG Trainer, follow these steps:
 
1. Go to [this link](https://flingtrainer.com/trainer/resident-evil-7-biohazard-trainer/) and click on the "Download" button.
2. Extract the zip file to a folder of your choice.
3. Run the trainer as administrator.
4. Launch the demo from Steam or your preferred platform.
5. In the trainer's window, press the hotkeys corresponding to the cheats you want to enable or disable. You can also click on the buttons or use the mouse wheel to change the values of some options.
6. Enjoy the game with your desired cheats!

Note: The trainer may not work with all versions of the game or may cause some glitches. Use it at your own risk and discretion. Also, some antivirus programs may detect the trainer as a virus or malware, but this is a false positive. You can add the trainer to your antivirus's whitelist or disable it temporarily while using the trainer.
  
## Gameplay Tips for the Demo
 
The demo is not a linear experience, and there are multiple endings and secrets to discover depending on your actions. Here are some tips to help you get the most out of the demo:

- Explore every corner and interact with everything you can. You might find useful items, clues, or hidden passages that can change the course of the demo.
- Pay attention to the sounds and the environment. Sometimes, you can hear noises or see changes that indicate something is happening or has happened in another area.
- Use your inventory wisely. You have a limited amount of space, so you might need to drop some items or combine them to make room for others.
- Save often. The demo has an auto-save feature, but you can also manually save your progress by using the tape recorder in the VHS Room. This way, you can reload your game if you get stuck or want to try a different path.
- Don't be afraid to experiment. The demo has multiple endings and secrets that require different actions and choices. Try different combinations of items, phone calls, VHS tapes, and doors to see what happens.

The demo is a teaser for the full game, Resident Evil 7 Biohazard, which is a survival horror game that features a first-person perspective, VR support, and a new story and setting. The full game is available for purchase on PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and PC.
