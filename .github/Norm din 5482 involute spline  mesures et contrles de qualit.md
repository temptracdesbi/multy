Norm DIN 5482 is a German standard for involute splines, which are toothed shaft joints with curved profiles that allow for torque transmission and axial movement. Involute splines are widely used in mechanical engineering, especially in gearboxes, pumps, and motors.

In this article, we will explain what norm DIN 5482 involute spline is, how it differs from other spline standards, and how to calculate its dimensions and strength using a software tool.
  
## What is Involute Spline?
  
An involute spline is a type of spline that has a profile based on the involute curve, which is the curve traced by a point on a taut string as it unwinds from a circle. The involute curve has some desirable properties for splines, such as:
  
- It is easy to generate and manufacture.
- It has a constant pressure angle along the tooth profile.
- It minimizes friction and wear between mating teeth.
- It allows for some misalignment and clearance between shafts.

An involute spline consists of an external spline (male) and an internal spline (female) that fit together. The external spline has teeth that project radially outward from a cylindrical base, while the internal spline has teeth that project radially inward from a cylindrical bore. The teeth of both splines have the same involute profile, but they are shifted by half a tooth space along the circumference.
  
The main parameters that define an involute spline are:

- The number of teeth (z).
- The module (m), which is the ratio of the pitch diameter (d) to the number of teeth.
- The pressure angle (Î±), which is the angle between the tooth profile and the radial line at the pitch point.
- The tooth height coefficients (ha\* and hf\*), which determine the tooth tip diameter (da) and the tooth root diameter (df) of the external spline.
- The tolerance series and zone, which specify the allowable deviations of the dimensions and the backlash or interference between the splines.

## What is Norm DIN 5482 Involute Spline?
  
Norm DIN 5482 is a German standard for involute splines that was released in 1950. It specifies the dimensions and tolerances of involute splines with a pressure angle of 30Â°. It also provides tables of standard sizes for internal and external splines with different modules and numbers of teeth.
  
Norm DIN 5482 differs from other spline standards, such as ISO 4156 or ANSI B92.1, in some aspects, such as:

- It uses tooth height coefficients instead of tooth thickness coefficients to define the tooth profile.
- It allows for self-defined non-standard splines by directly entering the tooth tip diameter and the tooth root diameter of both splines.
- It uses a different tolerance system based on DIN 5482-3:1973 or DIN 5480-1:2006.

## How to Calculate Norm DIN 5482 Involute Spline?
  
To calculate norm DIN 5482 involute spline, you need to know the following data:
 
WN10 software for involute splines according to DIN 5482,  Calculation of dimensions and strength of involute spline joint,  Tooth tip diameters and tooth root diameters of external and internal spline,  Tooth height coefficients and profile shift coefficients,  Tolerance system according to DIN 5482-3:1973 or DIN 5480-1:2006,  Span width and dimension over/between pins measurement,  Transferable torque or safety against permissible flank pressure,  True-scale tooth profile drawings with CAD interfaces DXF and IGES,  Production drawing of external spline and internal spline with ISO 7200 data field,  Involute splines with a pressure angle of 30°,  Involute splines with a number of teeth ranging from 6 to 82,  Involute splines with a module range from 0.5 to 10,  Involute splines according to DIN 5482 (Release 1950),  Involute splines according to Niemann (2005),  Involute splines with self-defined non-standard dimensions,  Profile database with DIN 5482 standard dimensions,  Database extension and modification by the user,  Tolerance series and tolerance zone selection,  Backlash or interference calculation,  No. of teeth meas. and pin diameter alteration,  Material properties selection from integrated database,  Table drawings with dimensions exportable to CAD,  Tooth contact and reference profile drawings,  Drawing header to DIN for production drawing,  HEXAGON software for involute splines calculation,  Involute splines based on reference diameters,  Involute splines with major diameter fit or side fit,  Involute splines with clearance fit or transition fit,  Involute splines with interference fit or force fit,  Involute splines with nominal dimensions and deviations,  Involute splines with measuring dimensions and tolerances,  Involute splines with tooth thickness allowances and backlash minimum values,  Involute splines with addendum modification coefficients and form diameter corrections,  Involute splines with tip relief and root relief modifications,  Involute splines with tooth profile quality grades and surface roughness values,  Involute splines with stress correction factors and load capacity factors,  Involute splines with bending stress calculation and contact stress calculation,  Involute splines with fatigue strength calculation and wear strength calculation,  Involute splines with load spectra and load distribution factors,  Involute splines with lubrication conditions and friction coefficients

- The module (m).
- The number of teeth (z).
- The tooth height coefficients (ha\* and hf\*) or the tooth tip diameter (da) and the tooth root diameter (df) of both splines.
- The tolerance series and zone.

You can either select a standard size from the norm DIN 5482 database or input your own dimensions. Then, you can use a software tool, such as WN10 by HEXAGON[^1^], to calculate the following results:

- The pitch diameter (d), base diameter (db), addendum diameter (da), dedendum diameter (df), mean diameter (dm), outside diameter (de), and inside diameter (di) of both splines.
- The span width (E) and dimension over/between pins (M) for measuring 8cf37b1e13
