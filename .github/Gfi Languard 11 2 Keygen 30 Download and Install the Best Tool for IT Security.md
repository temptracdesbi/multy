In this article, we will review some of the key features and benefits of GFI LanGuard, and how it can help you improve your network security and patch management.
 
## Patch Management for Operating Systems, Third-Party Apps and Web Browsers
 
One of the main functions of GFI LanGuard is to keep your network up to date with the latest patches for Windows, Mac OS X and Linux operating systems, as well as web browsers and third-party applications. GFI LanGuard can scan your network automatically or on demand, detect missing patches, download them from trusted sources, and deploy them centrally or on individual machines. You can also roll back patches if they cause any problems.
 
GFI LanGuard supports patching for popular applications such as Adobe Flash Player, Mozilla Firefox, Java Runtime and more. It also covers web browsers running on Windows systems, including Google Chrome, Apple Safari and Opera. By patching your systems regularly, you can prevent hackers from exploiting known vulnerabilities and reduce the risk of malware infections.
 
## Vulnerability Scanning and Network Auditing
 
GFI LanGuard can also identify and categorize security vulnerabilities on your network devices, such as computers, laptops, mobile phones, tablets, printers, routers and switches. It uses a vulnerability assessment database that includes standards such as OVAL (11,500+ checks) and SANS Top 20. The database is regularly updated with information from BugTraq, SANS Corporation, OVAL, CVE and more.
 
GFI LanGuard provides a threat level indicator graph that shows the severity of the vulnerabilities found on your scanned devices. It also recommends a course of action to resolve the issues, such as applying patches, changing settings or disabling services. You can use GFI LanGuard to perform network audits that give you a detailed overview of your network elements, such as connected USB devices, installed software, open shares, open ports, weak passwords and hardware information.
 
## Web-Based Reporting and Compliance
 
GFI LanGuard provides a web-based reporting interface that allows you to access your network security data from anywhere using a secure (https) connection. You can install multiple GFI LanGuard instances (sites) on large networks and use a single web console for a centralized view and aggregated reporting. You can also export reports to popular formats such as PDF, HTML, XLS, XLSX, RTF and CSV.
 
GFI LanGuard helps you demonstrate compliance with various regulatory standards such as PCI DSS, HIPAA and SOX. It provides automated network security reports that show how your network meets the requirements of these standards. You can also use GFI LanGuard to generate custom reports based on your own criteria.
